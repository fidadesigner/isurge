                            <p>Due to a flood of audit preparation solutions in the market, start-ups are often left to believe that if they align with a compliance framework, they will be secure. This type of thinking couldn’t be further from the truth.</p>
                            <p>A compliance framework offers guidance, but if these tasks are only seen as a “check box” exercise, they will have minimal effect on the organization’s overall security posture.</p>
