                            <p>Isurge emerged in 2020 from the vision of founders and former Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs), Stas Bojoukha and Simon Shaddock, who recognized the necessity for a unified solution to manage organizational security and compliance more effectively. They identified a critical gap in the existing methods, where companies were compelled to patch together a variety of single-solution tools in an attempt to address the ever-present question, “Are we secure?”. </p>
                            <p>This patchwork approach was not only cumbersome but often ineffective, leaving organizations in a perpetual state of uncertainty regarding their security posture. Designed by information security experts, Isurge introduces a modern integrated GRC strategy to confront this challenge head-on. Our platform serves as a powerhouse for organizations at any stage of their security journey, from those looking to implement a robust security foundation to enterprises seeking to enhance efficiency and automation within their current program.</p>
